## Hi, I'm Anshu 👋

I'm a B.Tech Information Technology student (2026) with a strong interest in
building clean, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

I enjoy working across the web stack using React and MERN-style architectures,
and I have also explored blockchain-based projects to understand decentralized
systems. I actively improve my skills by building projects and contributing
